THe goal is to Predict of new student score base on their study  hours data through the Machin Learnign Linear Regression based on a real dataset. 
THere is not any noise or misisng values in our dataset. 
Fisrtly I made my model of regression by 80% of data as train data, then I test my model by the rest of 20% of data. 
As the R2 Score:  0.9454906892105356, so I think the model id good for new input. 
Finally I add new input to my model to get their scores.
